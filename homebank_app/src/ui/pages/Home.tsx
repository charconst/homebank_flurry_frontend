                Listen carefully because you will only 
              get one opportunity to listen.Be on the lookout for any 
              clearly audible vocalization that is primarily communicative 
              or playful, such as speech, babble, cooing, crying, sighing,
              laughing, raspberries, clicks, etc. Please ignore vegetative 
              sounds, such as heavy breathing, hiccups, sneezes, sniffles, 
              and coughs, unless they appear to have been produced with a 
              communicative or playful purpose. You will be asked to enter 
              the codes (no spaces between) for the types of voices you 
              heard in the segment that just played. Codes: t for child 
              wearing the recorder, o for another child, a for adult. If 
              there are multiple voices present, enter the multiple codes 
              without spaces in between. Order of the codes does not matter.
               Leave the space blank if you did not hear any communicative 
              or playful vocalizations.
